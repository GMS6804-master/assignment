### Prerequisites
You will need to be comfortable with the following:
* You have installed docker, github-desktop and rstudio.
* You can pull from and push to GitHub from RStudio.
* Youâ€™ve taken possession of the course github repository.

### Twitter
I will use the @GMS6804 Twitter account to make micro-announcements, share interesting links, and facilitate a conversation amongst ourselves in public. I strongly encourage you to create a disposable account if for any reason you prefer not to share your personal account for classroom activities. Your participation on twitter will be part of your grade. In class, we talk about Twitter, its scholarly use, and privacy. Some relevant links:

* [Resources for exploring digital identity, privacy and authenticity](https://catherinecronin.wordpress.com/2012/02/29/525/)
